# 🧠 VR-EEG Therapy Assistant for Amputees

An innovative system combining *Virtual Reality* and *EEG (Electroencephalography) sensors* to collect neurological data from amputees, analyze patterns, and provide *AI-powered treatment recommendations*. Designed to aid rehabilitation, phantom limb pain relief, and personalized therapy plans.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project integrates:
- A *VR headset* with built-in *EEG sensors* to track brain signals.
- A *data analysis pipeline* to interpret EEG patterns and user interactions.
- An *AI recommendation engine* to suggest personalized rehabilitation treatments.

## 💡 Use Case

Many amputees suffer from phantom limb pain and difficulty in adapting to prosthetics. This project aims to:
- Monitor brain activity in immersive VR environments.
- Understand how the brain adapts post-amputation.
- Recommend therapy methods (e.g., mirror therapy in VR, mental training exercises) based on real-time brain data.

## 🛠 Features

- 🎮 Immersive VR environment tailored for amputees
- 🧠 Real-time EEG signal acquisition and preprocessing
- 📊 Database of user EEG + interaction data
- 🧬 Machine Learning for pattern recognition and recommendation generation
- 📈 Visual dashboard for data insights and tracking progress

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- *Hardware*: Custom VR headset with EEG module (e.g., OpenBCI, Muse, etc.)
- *Frontend*: Unity3D or Unreal Engine for VR scenes
- *Backend*: Python (Flask/FastAPI), Node.js
- *Database*: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- *Machine Learning*: TensorFlow / PyTorch
- *Signal Processing*: MNE, SciPy, NumPy

## 🔄 Workflow

1. User wears the VR headset with EEG sensors.
2. EEG data is captured while user interacts with VR environments.
3. Data is stored and processed using signal filtering and feature extraction.
4. AI models analyze patterns and suggest next steps for therapy.
5. Clinicians and users access a dashboard with recommendations and progress.

## 🧪 Future Scope

- Integration with prosthetic limbs for feedback-based training.
- Real-time biofeedback for enhanced immersion and recovery.
- Multi-user support for clinical testing.
- Gamified therapy sessions for motivation and engagement.
